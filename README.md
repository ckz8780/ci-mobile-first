# Welcome! 

This is a quick demonstration of the principles of mobile first design. Try resizing your browser. Below 992px width, left and right margins are removed and columns become full width. Otherwise there is a 10px margin on all sides and the columns take up 30% of the screen each, prividing a horizontal layout for larger screens.

This project has been lightly extended to:

- Add a header to the page
- Add a border radius of 5px to the columns
- Change the background color of the columns
- Display the columns as inline-block for screens above 992px, which allows us to...
- Center the set of 3 columns on larger screens, rather than using float: left
